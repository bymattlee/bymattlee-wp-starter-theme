## Tailwind CSS Notes

-   All Tailwind settings can be found in `./tailwind.config.js`
-   Most styles should be written as utility classes in the template markup but custom SCSS can be used for unique properties and/or magic numbers
-   Utilize the [`@apply`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) directive when writing custom SCSS for efficiency:

```scss
svg {
    @apply u-inline-block u-fill-current;
}
```

-   Tailwind settings can be accessed with the [`theme()`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#theme) function:

```scss
.button {
    animation-duration: theme('transitionDuration.normal');
}
```

-   Media queries can be used with the shorthand `screen()` function:

```scss
.button {
    margin-right: 2.8rem;
    @screen sm {
        margin-right: 4.2rem;
    }
}
```
